				Project Lion is a conservation programme. This was launched in 2002 as a joint initiative between local governments in East Africa. The project aims to ensure that a viable population of wild lions can remain in their natural habitats, protecting them from extinction and reducing their impact and interaction with humans. The aim is to develop and enhance the natural wildlife reserves and eco-systems. The fund has set up a Lion Protection Force to combat poachers and to fund the relocation of villagers to minimize human-lion conflicts.
